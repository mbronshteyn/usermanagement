# user management

Sample project to work with SpringBoot REST controllers, Bean Mapping libraries, Spring Data JPA and in-memory database.

The project has postman collection json file which can be used to trigger endpoints.  I have configured Spring Security Basic Authentication.  The username/password are in local properties file.  Just in case they are root/root.
